======

A simple python3 network-sniffer.

---------------------------------

Features:

- Watch TCP and/or UDP packages passing your primary network adapter
- Print information like header size, tos and payload to console

It's still in early alpha and many many things are missing right now.
I will work on it as often as I am able to.
